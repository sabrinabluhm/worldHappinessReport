## Project Description
Looking at the World Happiness Reports from 2015 - 2019, I was curious to find out which countries are the most happiest ones and which ones have a rather low ranking. 

## Questions
* Who are the mos happiest countries of the world?
* Which countries aren't that happy?

## Dataset
The datasat was downloaded from Kaggle. Futher the data was merged to one table using Python. The notebook can be found wihitn this repository. Furthermore another column was added to display the year of the data.

## Workflow

1. Explore the data and merge the different tables
2. Research the topic to see what different columns mean and how they are calculated
3. Sketch what the final story should look like
4. Tableau
5. Adjust visualizations to show a range of graph types, animation skills, and add annotations
